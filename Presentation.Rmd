## Introduction
This is a student project for Coursera course **Data Product**. The project is to deploy a shiny app that takes inputs from user interface in *ui.R* and generate statistical outputs from *server.R*. The application is launched at the platform from RStudio shinyapss.io, the source code is stored at github, and the presentation documentation is published on Rpub.

The dataset that I chose was from data library, and it contains advertising cost and sales data of a specific product in the past 36 months.

The materials can be found in:
